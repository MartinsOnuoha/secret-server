## How it Works

A Secret is provided to the server by the visitor, as well as the maximum number of times it can be viewed and when it should be deleted:

```javascript
"I ate all the cookies in the fridge"

"view this secret": 10 times

"delete this secret": On the 30th, January, 2021
```

The Frontend application sends this data to the secret server in this format:

```json
{
  "secret": "I ate all the cookies in the fridge",
  "expireAfterViews": 10,
  "expireAfter": "2021-01-30T03:36:16.543Z"
}
```

The server receives this data and encrypts the user's secret using AES **(Advanced Encryption Standard)** Encryption in CTR mode, using a server secret key.

```js
crypto.createCipheriv(ALGO, SECRET_KEY, IV);
```

The secret server doesn't save the secret in plain text:

```json
{
  "remainingViews": 5,
  "createdAt": "2021-01-21T10:19:14.918Z",
  "expiresAt": "2021-01-21T03:36:16.543Z",
  "_id": "600955250de4884054d0c029",
  "hash": "32f8a1ca19fd378a60a7c6cfc449557f",
  "secret": {
    "iv": "e0a4492c1399ea79e5da0e848a60ab4e",
    "encryptedContent": "f647465a31184cfd3bbc7affb96d80355363a26f6e743b88"
  },
  "__v": 0
}
```

When the secret is retrived the server deciphers the stored secret to plain text and reduces the views count:

```js
"I ate all the cookies in the fridge"

```
